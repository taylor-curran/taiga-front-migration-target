- **Services ‚Üí React Hooks/Context**: 36+ services
- **Filters ‚Üí Utility Functions**: Multiple filters

### **Missing Infrastructure**
- State management (Redux/Context for complex state)
- Authentication flow & token management
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- File upload/download capabilities

## üìä Migration Progress Summary

**Overall Completion: ~15-20%**

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Foundation** | ‚úÖ 100% | React setup, routing, API connectivity |
| **Public Pages** | üî∂ 40% | Home and Projects complete, detail pages are stubs |
| **Authentication** | ‚ùå 0% | Not started |
| **Project Features** | ‚ùå 0% | Read-only stubs only |
| **Agile Tools** | ‚ùå 0% | Basic page shells only |
| **Collaboration** | ‚ùå 0% | Not started |
| **Admin/Settings** | ‚ùå 0% | Not started |

## üéØ Next Priority Items

Based on the migration plan, the immediate next steps should be:

1. **Phase 3**: Implement public Project Detail page with stats
2. **Phase 4**: Build read-only Backlog view  
3. **Phase 4**: Build read-only Kanban Board view
4. **Phase 5**: Add public Wiki viewer

## üìÅ Project Locations

- **Original AngularJS App**: `/Users/taylorcurran/Documents/demos/homemade/taiga-front`
- **React Migration Target**: `/Users/taylorcurran/Documents/demos/homemade/taiga-front-migration-target`

## üìù Notes

The scaffold provides a solid foundation, but the vast majority of Taiga's functionality remains to be migrated from the AngularJS/CoffeeScript codebase to React. The migration follows a phased approach, starting with public-facing features that don't require authentication, then progressively adding more complex authenticated features.
