## ❌ Still Needs Migration

### **From Original App (18+ Core Modules)**
The original AngularJS app has extensive functionality that hasn't been migrated:

#### **Authentication & User Management**
- Login/Register/Logout
- User profiles & settings
- Team management
- Permissions system

#### **Project Management Features**
- Project creation/editing
- Project settings & admin
- Team member management
- Private projects access

#### **Agile Tools** (Currently read-only stubs)
- **Backlog**: User stories, sprint planning, story points
- **Kanban Board**: Drag-drop functionality, WIP limits
- **Taskboard**: Task management, assignments
- **Epics**: Epic tracking and management

#### **Collaboration Features**
- **Wiki**: Page creation/editing, attachments
- **Issues**: Issue tracking, filters, assignments
- **Comments & Activity**: Real-time updates
- **Notifications**: In-app & email notifications

#### **Additional Modules**
- **Search**: Advanced search across all entities
- **Admin Panel**: Project/instance administration
- **Import/Export**: Data migration tools
- **External Apps**: Integrations (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- **Reports & Analytics**: Burndown charts, velocity

### **Technical Debt**
- **CoffeeScript → JavaScript**: 100+ CoffeeScript files to convert
- **Jade/Pug Templates → JSX**: 200+ templates to rewrite
- **AngularJS Directives → React Components**: 100+ directives
- **Services → React Hooks/Context**: 36+ services
- **Filters → Utility Functions**: Multiple filters

### **Missing Infrastructure**
- State management (Redux/Context for complex state)
- Authentication flow & token management
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- File upload/download capabilities
- Rich text editor integration
- Markdown renderer

## 📊 Migration Progress Summary

**Overall Completion: ~20-25%**

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Foundation** | ✅ 100% | React setup, routing, API connectivity |
| **Public Pages** | 🔶 60% | Home, Projects, and ProjectDetail complete; Backlog/Kanban are stubs |
| **Authentication** | ❌ 0% | Not started |
| **Project Features** | ❌ 0% | Read-only stubs only |
| **Agile Tools** | ❌ 0% | Basic page shells only |
| **Collaboration** | ❌ 0% | Not started |
| **Admin/Settings** | ❌ 0% | Not started |

## 🎯 Next Priority Items

Based on the migration plan, the immediate next steps should be:

1. ~~**Phase 3**: Implement public Project Detail page with stats~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
2. **Phase 4**: Build read-only Backlog view  
3. **Phase 4**: Build read-only Kanban Board view
4. **Phase 5**: Add public Wiki viewer

## 📁 Project Locations

- **Original AngularJS App**: `/Users/taylorcurran/Documents/demos/homemade/taiga-front`
- **React Migration Target**: `/Users/taylorcurran/Documents/demos/homemade/taiga-front-migration-target`

## 📝 Notes

The scaffold provides a solid foundation, but the vast majority of Taiga's functionality remains to be migrated from the AngularJS/CoffeeScript codebase to React. The migration follows a phased approach, starting with public-facing features that don't require authentication, then progressively adding more complex authenticated features.
